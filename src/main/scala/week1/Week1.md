**Week 1 notes:**

Functional languages stick to mathematical theories (e.g. Polynomials once defined, coefficients cannot be changed)

**Evaluation is left to right in order of precedence:**

> e.g. (2 * pi) * radius

**Definitions can also have parameters**

e.g.

> def square(x : Double) = x * x
> 
> square: (Double)Double
